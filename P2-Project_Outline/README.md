# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My idea is for an application that allows a musician to keep track of and compare how much time they spend practicing different skills. 
This inspiration came from being a guitar player who struggles both with 1) keeping a record of my practice, and 2) maintaining balance between the skills I practice over time.  I frequently find myself practicing a couple of things heavily for several months, only to realize I haven’t touched some other important stuff in a long time. I know other musicians who struggle with this as well. I’m hoping this app will give any musician an easier option to document, organize, and review exactly what they’ve been practicing and for how long, as well as the ability to compare practice trends visually in a chart or graph.  

### Features
1) Account Creation: 
Users will have the ability to create an account, log in/out, and view a profile page. 

2) Record a Practice Session: 
Users will be able to record a session with a date, instrument, list of practice items, and times for each item. This information can will be saved to a database. 

3) Use a Built-in Timer: 
Users can enter times manually OR use a timer/stopwatch on the page.

4) Compare Saved Sessions:
Users can compare session data in a table form, or (hopefully) in a chart/graph form.

5) View Average/Median times:
Users can view average/median of time spent practicing given practice items over a longer period time (a group of sessions).

6) Practice Item List:
Users can save and access a running list of Practice Items for repeated use in new sessions, rather than having to manually enter the same item again and again. 

### Technologies
- Java/Spring Boot
- MAMP/MySQL
- Thymeleaf/CSS/HTML
- Javascript? JSON? (for dynamic chart/graph representations of data)
- Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
- I'll need to do more research, but my initial research on displaying data graphically brought me to JavaScript libraries that used JSON. I have no experience with Javascript/JSON.
- I'll have to learn my way around BootStrap. I had only a brief experience with it during LC101.
